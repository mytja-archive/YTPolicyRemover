# YTPolicyRemover
Everybody knows that box on YouTube! It is the annoying box, that shows you up for agreeing with the new ToS and to login! Here is an extention to simply remove them!

# How it works?
After 5 seconds, YouTube will show its popup, our extension blocks it at the same time, so that you can't even see it, or you can see it a little bit! It is very simple!

# Bugs

# Updated stable release
This is a always updated release for all browsers, automated with GitHub Actions on every push: https://github.com/mytja/YTPolicyRemover/releases/tag/stable

# How to load it into

## Chrome
Chrome is a very fast and easy to use browser! Just download zip file of code, unpack it, then head over to chrome://extensions and turn on the Developer options! Now you can see 3 options! Pick a 1st one! Pick a folder, with JS files inside and then you have it!

## Other Chromium based browsers
Chrome is built on Chromium, an open source browser! There are many more browsers built on Chromium, e.g. Edge, Opera, Brave Browser...

Extension managing is I think very similar than on Chrome!

## Firefox
Firefox doesn't require different code from Chromium code, which means, code for Chromium can work without problems also on Firefox

# Plans
- Code is not that efficient! If YouTube changes anything, code might not work anymore! Report it in issues!
